 		This Personal web page is an ongoing project. This is a personal portfolio/blog site that will showcase my ongoing hands on projects as well as my journey from a plumber to a job in the cyber security field. This site is being used as a project to show my skills in basic web design, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This will be an ongoing project because Im going to continue to improve my skills and make the site better with the more I learn.

 		A virtual lab is a way to create a safe environment to practice and learn.  I am running Oracle VirtualBox and on there I run Kali Linux, Windows Server 2022, and I run various vulnerable machines to practice on.  This can also be use to run tryHackMe hands on labs.
